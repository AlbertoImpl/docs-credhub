# Deployment Architecture

CredHub consists of two primary architectures. You can choose either depending on your requirements. The architecture options are: 

* Co-located on a customer VM, or 
* as an independently deployed and managed service.

## Co-located on a VM

The config server implementation of the BOSH Director uses the co-location architecture. This is appropriate for this application, given its single instance and unique bootstrap problem of deploying itself as the first VM in an environment.

This architecture benefits from low latency and simplicity for a single consumer. If you require high availability or anticipate many consumers, this configuration is not appropriate.

For more information about deploying CredHub with BOSH, read [Setting Up and Deploying CredHub with BOSH](./setup-credhub-bosh.html).

## Deployed as a Service

You can also deploy CredHub as an independent service on one or more VMs. The application does not hold state, so you can scale it to multiple instances that share a common database cluster and encryption provider.

This architecture benefits from high availability and scale. However, the additional cost and complexity may not be suitable for a single or small number of consumers.
